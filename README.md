Description
A Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text with a user-defined shift value.
Explanation
This code provides a simple command-line interface for encrypting or decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher technique. Users can input the text and choose the shift value, which determines how many positions each letter is shifted in the alphabet. The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving non-alphabetic characters.
